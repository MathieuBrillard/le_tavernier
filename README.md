## Installation

First of all, you need to download the latest version of [python] (I used v3.9.7 to write this bot).
You will also need to download the git-full version of [ffmpeg]. After that, copy the folder inside the archive
    in the bot folder, and rename it like "ffmpeg".

Now, start a terminal inside the bot folder.
You can download automatically the libraries used in the bot by tipping this command :
```sh
python install/install.py
```

To launch the bot, just need to run the following : 
```sh
python bot.py
```

## Development

You can get the lastest version of the bot on the following [repository].
